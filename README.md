## Getting started⚡
Give <a href="https://magazine.joomla.org/all-issues/may-2021/vs-code-use-it-like-a-pro">this</a> blog a read. Here i have written a 101 guide to VScode and helps while using GitHub

### How to find issues⁉:-
- Learn some coding languages/frameworks. But in case you dont know, its still okay. you Can contribute and <code>learn on the go</code>
- find goood first issues <a href="https://goodfirstissues.com/">here</a>

                          OR
- You can also find Good first issues by Github Search.
> paste this in the search
   <code>is:open is:issue no:assignee label:"good first issue" archived:false </code>
   
you can add additional parameter of <code>language:<LANGUAGE_YOU_KNOW></code>
example:    <code>is:open is:issue no:assignee label:"good first issue" archived:false <b>language:html</b> </code>

### How to get issues assigned🔗 
In most organisations, you are welcome to find an issue and send PR directly, but that is not a good practice. I prefer simple workflow <b>comment> commit> create PR</b>

 <b>COMMENT</b>:- comment on the issue of your interest and ask to be assigned for the issue. Issues are generally assigned on first-come-first-serve basis.
 
 <b>COMMIT</b>:- fork the repo, make changes, and <b>commit changes to new branch</b>. But why a new branch? the reason is simple. Suppose you are working on multiple issues, it gives flexibility. 
 
 <b>CREATE PR</b>:- now, set your branch to the new branch that have the changes codes. Click on contribute, compare and send a PR.
 
⚠ A NOTE FOR PR. 

kindly send a well documented PR and attach media whenever needed. If your PR solves an already exixting issue, in your PR description, mention that issue by writing #{issue_id}.Issue id can be found in issue itself

#### wait for the repo owners to review your PR, and if it does the job, it will be merged!🎉
